Carbon capture and storage (“ CCS”) is the post-\ncombustion process of separating CO 2 from flue gases, and \nconditioning the gas for transportation and permanent \nstorage in deep underground fields. Carbon capture and \nutilization (“ CCU”) is the use of captured CO 2 for the \nmanufacturing of sustainable chemicals and e-fuels, as well \nas for the manufacturing of fertilizers (urea), for greenhouses \n(enhanced biomass growth) and in the food industry.\n“By removing CO 2 emissions from energy-intensive industrial \nprocesses, carbon capture has an important role in the \nroadmap to net zero emissions by 2050. In its 2022 World \nEnergy Outlook, the IEA estimates that 1.2 Gt of CO 2 will need \nto be captured by 2030, rising to 6.2 Gt by 2050.

The \nTaxonomy Regulation (the “ EU Taxonomy ”) is a key \ncomponent of the European Commission’s action plan to \nredirect capital flows towards a more sustainable economy. \nIt consists in a classification system that establishes a list of \nenvironmentally sustainable economic activities. The aim of \nthe EU Taxonomy is to provide companies, investors and \npolicymakers with clear definitions of economic activities \nwhich can be considered as environmentally sustainable. This \nprovides clarity and security for investors, helps companies \nto become more climate-friendly, mitigates market \nfragmentation and helps to shift investments where they are \nmost needed.\nThe Taxonomy Regulation came into force July 12, 2020.

It \nsets out the conditions an economic activity must meet to \nqualify as environmentally sustainable. The regulation \nestablishes six environmental objectives:\n■climate change mitigation;\n■climate change adaptation;\n■the sustainable use and protection of water and marine \nresources;\n■the transition to a circular economy; \n■pollution prevention and control; and\n■the protection and restoration of biodiversity and \necosystems.\nThe first delegated act concerning the technical screening \ncriteria for economic activities with significant contribution \nto climate change mitigation and adaptation (the ‘Climate \nDelegated Act’) was published in the EU Official Journal in \nDecember 2021.

page_content='4.1. RISK MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW\nThe recognition of risks, threats and opportunities is an \nintegral part of the management process across our \noperations, in projects, operating centers, clusters, business \nlines and administrative functions. We have implemented and \nwe are constantly maintaining an adequate system of \ninternal control and risk management processes. This \nencompasses relevant organizational structures and \nprocedures designed to safeguard our rights and assets, \nensure the effectiveness and efficiency of our internal \nprocedures, the reliability of our financial reporting and strict \ncompliance with laws, regulations and best practices \napplicable to our businesses. \nWithin Technip Energies risk management is not a process \nthat runs in isolation from the rest of our activities but \nrather is an integral part of existing company and business \nprocesses.

page_content='KEY AUDIT MATTER OUR AUDIT WORK AND OBSERVATIONS\nRevenue recognition and determination of estimated costs to \ncomplete for long-term contracts\nSee Notes 1.6, 1.7 and 4 to the financial statements\nThe majority of the Group’s total revenue of €6.3 billion for \nthe year ended December 31, 2022 is generated from long-\nterm contracts. For the Group’s long-term contracts, because \nof control transferring over time, revenue is recognized based \non the extent of progress towards completion of the \nperformance obligation. The selection of the method to \nmeasure progress towards completion requires judgement \nand is based on the nature of the products or services to be \nprovided. \nThe Group generally uses the cost-to-cost measure of \nprogress for its contracts considering it best depicts the \ntransfer of control to the customer which occurs as the \nGroup incurs costs on the  contracts.

page_content='transfer of control to the customer which occurs as the \nGroup incurs costs on the  contracts. Under the cost-to-cost \nmeasure of progress, the extent of progress towards \ncompletion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred \nto date to the total estimated costs at completion of the \nperformance obligation. Revenues are recorded proportionally \nas costs are incurred. Due to the nature of the work required \nto be performed on many of the performance obligations, \nmanagement’s estimation of total cost at completion is \ncomplex, subject to many variables and requires significant \njudgement.\nAs the estimate of costs to complete for long-term contracts \ninvolves significant judgement by management that is \nsubjective in nature, this area is subject to higher risk of \nmisstatement due to error or fraud. Therefore, we considered \nthese estimates as a key audit matter.We obtained an understanding of the Group’s long-term \ncontracts and associated revenue and receivable process' metadata={'source': '/content/gdrive/My Drive/Documents/T.EN_2022 AR_FINAL_13 03 23.pdf-2023-03-14-14-33.pdf', 'page': 339}
